## Background

There are lots of ways to make figures in R. These include so-called "base R" graphics (e.g. `plot()`) and tons of add-on packages like **ggplot2**.

For example, here we make the same plot with both:

```{r}
head(cars)
```

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
First, I need to install the package with the command `install.packages()`.

> **N.B** We never run an install cmd in a quarto code chunk or we will end up re-installing packages many many times - which is not what we want!


Every time we want to use one of these "add-on" packages, we need to load it up in R with the `library()` function:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(cars)
```

Every ggplot needs at least 3 things:

- The **data**, the stuff you want plotted
- The **aes**thetics, how the data maps to the plot
- The **geom**etry, the type of plot

```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point()
```

Add a line to better show relationship between speed and dist

```{r}
p <- ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Stopping distance of old cars",
       subtitle = "Data from the `cars` object",
       x = "Speed (mph)",
       y = "Distance (ft)")
```

Render it out:

```{r}
p + theme_bw()
```

## Gene expression plot

We can read the input data from the class website:

```{r}
url <- "https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_S20/class-material/up_down_expression.txt"
genes <- read.delim(url)
head(genes)
```

A first version plot:

```{r}
ggplot(genes) + 
    aes(Condition1, Condition2) +
    geom_point()
```
```{r}
table(genes$State)
```

Version 2: Let's color by `State` so we can see the up and down significant genes compared to all the unchanging genes.

```{r}
ggplot(genes) + 
    aes(Condition1, Condition2, col = State) +
    geom_point()
```

Version 3 Plot: Let's modify the default colors to something we like.

```{r}
ggplot(genes) + 
    aes(Condition1, Condition2, col = State) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("blue","gray","orange")) +
  labs(x = "Control (no drug)",
       y = "Drug",
       title = "Gene Expression Changes upon GLP-1 Drug") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Going Further

Let's have a look at the famous **gapminder** dataset:

```{r}
# File location online
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/gapminder/master/inst/extdata/gapminder.tsv"

gapminder <- read.delim(url)
```

```{r}
head(gapminder, 3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, col = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)
```

Let's "facet" (i.e. make a separate plot) by continent rather than the big hot mess above.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, col = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

## Custom plots

How big is this gapminder dataset?

```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
```
I want to "filter" down to a subset of this data. I will use the **dplyr** package to help me.

First, I need to install it and then load it up...
`install.packages("dplyr")` and then `library(dplyr)`

```{r}
library(dplyr)

gm2007 <- filter(gapminder, year == 2007)
head(gm2007)
```

```{r}
filter(gm2007, country == "Ireland")
```

```{r}
filter(gapminder, year == 2007, country == "Ireland")
```

```{r}
filter(gapminder, year == 2007, country == "United States")
```

> Q. Make a plot comparing 1977 and 2007 for all countries

```{r}
gm <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1977, 2007))

ggplot(gm, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, col = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~year)
```
